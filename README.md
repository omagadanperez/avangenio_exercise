Steps to run the application:

First Variant:
 - Move to server folder and run the command python server.py
 - Move to client folder and run the command python client.py

Second Variant:
 - Run the application with Docker. In this case, a small HTML page was implemented to simulate a real-world scenario with a client and a server.
- If you have the "make" command installed, you can run "make build" from the project root folder.
- Otherwise, you can run "docker-compose up --build -d" from the project root folder to compile and start the containers.
